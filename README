units:
  
  The units used are the same as GROMACS MD Units.  See the GROMACS
  manual for explanation.


default params:

  See the example input file in files/.


notes on modification:

  All of the potential energy functions and energy/force calculation methods
  are contained in the potentials section of the ParticleSystem object.  This
  is so that one can easily add new potential functional forms and hence new
  particle types to the system.  To do so:

  	   * edit the particles files to add the new particle type to the 
	     Particle class
	   * add the identification string to ParticleLabel in utils
	   * add the interaction potential(s) to the potentials section of
	     the ParticleSystem class.
	   * edit ParticleSystem::get_pair_enery to incorporate the new
	     functions

  It should Just Work.


caveats:
  
  I've yet to implement any exception handling, and I doubt I'll get around to
  it anytime soon.  The most likely place this could hurt you is if you mess
  something up in the input file since I don't sanity check the values of the
  parameters.  If you submit something incorrectly, you will get segfaults most
  likely.  It shouldn't be too hard to figure out though, if you know what you
  are doing.
