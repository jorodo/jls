some things that need to be done eventually:

 * wrap all files in a JLS namespace

 * break up the Particle System object into parent/child classes
   - This will permit code optimization by removing all the "if's"
   - Make the ParticleSystem class the parent class
   - NVTSytem derives from ParticleSystem
   - NPTSystem derives from NVTSystem
   - etc.

 * inline frequently-used small functions

some things that may be done eventually:

 * exception handling
   -sanity test input; stuff breaks at the moment

please send suggestions to jrdowdle at gmail dot com
